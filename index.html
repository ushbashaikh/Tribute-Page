            <h2>Early life and Education</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>✦ Abdul Sattar Edhi  (February 1928 – 8 July 2016) was a Pakistani humanitarian.</li>
                <li>✦ Edhi was a Gujarati Muhajir born into a Memon Muslim family in Bantva, </li>

                <li>✦ Always telling others that <quote class="text-italic"> "empty words and long phrases do not impress God"</quote> and to

            <h2>Career and Charity Work</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>✦ At the age of 20, Edhi joined a <strong> Memon charity </strong> as a volunteer. However, once he found out 
                    that the charity only attended to the needs of Memon people, he confronted his superiors to no avail, which caused 
                    him to leave to form an independent medical centre.</li>

                <li>✦ Edhi resolved to dedicate his life to aiding the poor, and over the next sixty years, he single-handedly changed 
                    the face of welfare in Pakistan. </li>

                <li>✦ He subsequently founded the <strong> Edhi Foundation </strong>. Edhi was known for his ascetic lifestyle, owning only two pairs of clothes,
                    never taking a salary from his organization, and living in a small apartment next to his organization's office.</li>

                <li>✦ Additionally, his previously established welfare trust, named the Edhi Trust was restarted with an initial sum of 
                    Rs.5000, the trust was later renamed after his wife as the Bilquis Edhi Trust.</li>

                <li>✦ The Edhi Foundation has rescued over <i>20,000 </i> abandoned infants, rehabilitated over
                    <i>50,000 </i> orphans, and trained over <i>40,000 </i> nurses. </li>

                <li>✦ It also runs more than <i>330</i> welfare centers throughout rural and urban Pakistan that operate as 
                    food kitchens, rehabilitation homes, shelters for abandoned women and children, and clinics for the mentally 
                    and physically handicapped. </li>
                    
                <li>✦ It runs the <i>world's largest volunteer ambulance service</i> (operating over 1,500 of them) 
                    and offers <strong> 24-hour emergency services.</strong></li>

                <li>✦ One of his last wishes was that his organs be donated for the use of the needy but due to his poor health,
